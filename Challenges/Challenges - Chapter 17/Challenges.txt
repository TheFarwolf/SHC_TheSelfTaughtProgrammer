1.) Write a regular expression to match "Dutch" 
    $grep Dutch xen.txt
2.) Come up with a regular expression that matches all 
    the digits in the string "Arizona 479, 501, 870. California 209, 213, 650"
    $grep [[:digit:]] statecodes.txt
3.) Create a regex that matches any ward tha starts with any character and
    is followed by two o's. Then use pythons re module to match boo and 
    loo in the sentence "The ghost that says boo haunts the loo"
    <code>
        import re
        line = "The ghost that says boo haunts the loo"
        m = re.findall(".oo", line, re.IGNORECASE)
        print(m)
    </code>
